## Documents
Every repository should have all the following documents, even if they are empty.
### .editorconfig
A editorconfig will make sure every editor behaves the same. What every editorconfig should include are.
- indent_style: The preffered style is tabs.
- indent_size: The preffered size is 4.
- tab_width: This should match the indent_size.
- end_of_line: LF is preffered for intercompatability.
- charset: While there is a argument for using UTF-16 we will stick to UTF-8 due to using less memory. 
- trim_trailing_whitespace: The preffered style is true.
- insert_final_newline: The preffered style is true.
- max_line_length: The preffered value is 80
- root: Set to true unless there are other editorconfigs in the repository.

These may look different depending on the language but a example is included in this repository
